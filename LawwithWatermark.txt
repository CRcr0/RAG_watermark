"While Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, it is required to do so in a manner that is uniform across the United States, thereby ensuring fair and equitable treatment of all states."
"Although Congress is vested with significant legislative powers, it is prohibited from making any law that establishes a religion or impedes the free exercise of religion, nor can it abridge the freedoms of speech, press, or the right of the people to assemble peaceably and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances, safeguarding essential civil liberties."
"The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age, affirming the importance of representation for all adult citizens."

"Given that the judicial power of the United States is vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time establish, it ensures a hierarchical judicial system, where judges hold their offices during good behavior and are compensated in a manner that cannot be diminished during their continuance in office."
"The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made under their authority, encompassing a broad range of legal matters, including those affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls."

"No person shall be elected to the office of President more than twice, and this limitation on presidential terms ensures that no individual can hold this powerful position indefinitely, fostering a healthy rotation in leadership."
"Congress, having the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived, does so without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration, thereby exercising its authority in fiscal matters comprehensively."
